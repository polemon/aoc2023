* Per day, each file is named: `dayNN.EXT`, where `NN` is a two-digit number (01 to 24), and `EXT` is any file extension applicable.
* Input is in the form of a UTF-8 encoded file following this naming scheme: `dayNN.in.utf8` (`NN` as above).
* Output is written directly to the shell.
* In case the question is a two-parter, only the second solution is tracked, however usually the first part is completed using a shellscript, etc.
* A Markdown file (scheme: `dayNN.md`) contains notes for that day's puzzle.
